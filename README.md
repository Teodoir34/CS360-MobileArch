Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of my app was to create an inventory system that utilized authentication, a database, and allowed for referencing at any time. This meant that I would need to utilize a CRUD system to allow both the creation and maintainence of a user system and an item cataloging system. It was also important that the app recorded who made the changes in order to allow potential admin users to track changes in the event the inventory was not appropriately accounted for. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The required screens were: Login, register, forgot password, home page, inventory edit page, SMS pop-up, and an add item pop up for new item creation. My UI kept users in mind by making sure that the buttons were labeled where necessary and also in expected areas using best practices for design via visual indicators and location.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached the process realitively chaotically and I think this was a great lesson in how immportant it is to lay a stable groundwork for future development. In the future I believe a better understanding and outlining of requirements, further consideration of design prior to dev, and then a structured development plan will create a better app with a more strategic flow and less time consumption!

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I repeatedly tested my app after every feature implementation and was sure to test functionality of everything to make sure that the new feature I created didn't somehow break something that I previously noted as working. I think this process of testing was important and I started it because during the first project one thing I implemented worked fine and then I set up two other items and suddenly the first part wasn't working and I had no idea why. I essentially had to restart and go line by line to figure out what exactly was "technically written correctly" but still breaking. even with this process there are still times where things break and so it's much easier to locate these items if you approach with a regular testing cadence. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I think I had to innovate during the development process because I don't think I did enough during the designing portion to provide myself a strong understanding of what I was trying to accomplish. In the future I think  I will be able to move forward with more ease by allowing myself more time to commit to the design so I don't have to struggle through the development and tackle quite as many issues.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think setting up the SQL database is where I was able to showcase my skill the most because I have a lot of experience with database management and the application my company has is a system that utillizes a variety of databases and visual modeling - so while I have no access or part in that portion of our company, I do understand how the utilization should function enough to know what I wanted to see and what I didn't want to see.

Overall I really enjoyed this call and plan to further add to the app for my own personal project!
